Using bacteria to produce therapeutics inside the gut can increase their bioavailability and minimize off-target effects by localizing the therapeutic to the site of action. In order to establish an engineered organism into a competitive environment such as the human gut, it is important to use a strain that is adapted to such an environment. However, most gut-adapted strains are difficult to engineer due to a lack of genetic tools or parts (promoters, ribosome binding sites, and insulation components). In my PhD work, I have developed a system for rapidly engineering the genome of probiotic strains of E. coli, characterized genetic parts in these organisms, and used these characterized parts to build genetic circuits. This work has enabled the construction of robust genetic circuits in therapeutically-relevant bacteria, a key component to developing the next generation of living medicines.
